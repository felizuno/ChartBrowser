##Real Goals:
* Build playlists to push to Rdio
* live update a queue
* shuffle past charts
* Discovery mode: uses your collection to remove artists you already know
* Use history for url modification/loading

##TODO
* Load artist info with album art
* narrow selection to range (requires range to contain li's)
* Don't add albumoptions until the playlist option is clicked?
* Ability to collapse menus for playlistoptions
* Minimized view for chart items
* Less jangly chooser
