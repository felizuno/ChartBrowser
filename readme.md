Real Goals:
- Build playlists to push to Rdio
- Chooser to build which file to request


Big Goals:

**Download past KEXP playlists and recreate them with Rdio
- show a page with the playlist represented by Rdio albumart
- create a playlist? at least allow play/preview individually

**Scrape (or subscribe via RSS) the KEXP live playlist 
- create a view that updates with the "on air" track
- use this to create a temporary playlist until the official show playlist is cut
- allows the user to add songs they like to thier collection
- live update a queue?
