##Real Goals:
* Build playlists to push to Rdio
* live update a queue
* shuffle past charts
* Discovery mode: uses your collection to remove artists you already know
* Use history for url modification/loading

##TODO
* Use the name and artist properties of the request response to choose album (not just [0])
* Don't add albumoptions until the playlist option is clicked?
* Minimized view for chart items
* Less jangly chooser - month groups for ranges
