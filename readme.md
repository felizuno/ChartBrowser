#Chart Browser (prototype)

(Not the) latest at: http://kexptopcharts.appspot.com/

To use:
* Wait for the menu to drop down in the upper-left (won't appear until Rdio API is ready)
* Choose a genre and year
* Click "Load/replace" in the orange bar at the bottom of the chooser


###Real Goals:
* Build playlists to push to Rdio
* live update a queue
* shuffle past charts
* Discovery mode: uses your collection to remove artists you already know
* Use history for url modification/loading

###TODO
* Use the name and artist properties of the request response to choose album (not just [0])
* Don't add albumoptions until the playlist option is clicked?
* Minimized view for chart items
* Less jangly chooser - month groups for ranges
